= Scoresheets
:author: Avah Whitehead

== Why?

As the records office for an archery club, I inherited a couple of massively complicated spreadsheets from the previous person.
These spreadsheets have been the bane of my existence ever since and so I am building a simple app to store the data I need in an sqlite database.

The goal is to speed up adding scores to the club records, and to reduce the maintenance overhead when ArcheryGB inevitably changes their categories again.

== Technology

* Python 3
* Tkinter gui (already beginning to regret this, but hey ho)
* sqlite3 database
